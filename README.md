👩‍💻 Aspiring Data Analyst | SQL | Power BI | Excel | Data Enthusiast

Hello! I'm Karishma Sharma , an enthusiastic learner diving into the world of data analysis. My goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive informed decisions. Currently, I'm honing my skills in:

SQL: Writing queries to extract and manipulate data.
Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards to visualize trends and patterns.
Excel: Building reports, performing advanced analysis, and automating workflows.
💡 I’m passionate about discovering stories hidden in data and solving real-world problems using analytical tools.

📈 Current Focus:

Building projects in SQL, Power BI, and Excel to showcase my skills.
Learning how to clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively.

📚 Background:
I hold a strong academic foundation with hands-on experience in research and technology, including a research assistant role in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

🌱 Learning Journey:
I’ve started this GitHub repository to document my growth and share the projects I’ve been working on. Each project reflects my progress as I learn and apply new skills.

✨ When I’m not working on data, I enjoy reading, exploring new technologies, and staying active.
